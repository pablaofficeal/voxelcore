# *app* library

A library for high-level engine control, available only in script or test mode.

The script/test name without the path and extension is available as `app.script`. The file path can be obtained as:
```lua
local filename = "script:"..app.script..".lua"
```

Since the control script may not belong to any of the packs, it does not belongs to its own package and has its own global namespace in which all global functions and tables are available, as well as the `app` library.

## Functions

```lua
app.tick()
```

Performs one tick of the main engine loop.

```lua
app.sleep(time: number)
```

Waits for the specified time in seconds, performing the main engine loop.

```lua
app.sleep_until(
    -- function that checks the condition for ending the wait
    predicate: function() -> bool,
    -- maximum number of engine loop ticks after which
    -- a "max ticks exceed" exception will be thrown
    [optional] max_ticks = 1e9,
    -- maximum wait time in seconds.
    -- (works with system time, including test mode)
    [optional] timeout = 1e9
)
```

Waits for the condition checked by the function to be true, performing the main engine loop.

```lua
app.quit()
```

Terminates the engine, printing the call stack to trace the function call location.

```lua
app.reconfig_packs(
    -- packs to add
    add_packs: table,
    -- packs to remove
    remove_packs: table
)
```

Updates the packs configuration, checking its correctness (dependencies and availability of packs).
Automatically adds dependencies.

To remove all packs from the configuration, you can use `pack.get_installed()`:

```lua
app.reconfig_packs({}, pack.get_installed())
```

In this case, `base` will also be removed from the configuration.

```lua
app.config_packs(
    -- expected set of packs (excluding dependencies)
    packs: table
)
```

Updates the packs configuration, automatically removing unspecified ones, adding those missing in the previous configuration.
Uses app.reconfig_packs.

```lua
app.is_content_loaded() -> bool
```

Checks if content is loaded.

```lua
app.new_world(
    -- world name, empty string will create a nameless world
    name: str,
    -- generation seed
    seed: str,
    -- generator name
    generator: str
    -- local player id
    [optional] local_player: int=0
)
```

Creates a new world and opens it.

```lua
app.open_world(name: str)
```

Opens a world by name.

```lua
app.reopen_world()
```

Reopens the world.

```lua
app.save_world()
```

Saves the world.

```lua
app.close_world(
    -- save the world before closing
    [optional] save_world: bool=false
)
```

Closes the world.

```lua
app.delete_world(name: str)
```

Deletes a world by name.

```lua
app.get_version() -> int, int
```

Returns the major and minor versions of the engine.

```lua
app.get_setting(name: str) -> value
```

Returns the value of a setting. Throws an exception if the setting does not exist.

```lua
app.set_setting(name: str, value: value)
```

Sets the value of a setting. Throws an exception if the setting does not exist.

```lua
app.get_setting_info(name: str) -> {
    -- default value
    def: value,
    -- minimum value
    [only for numeric settings] min: number,
    -- maximum value
    [only for numeric settings] max: number
}
```

Returns a table with information about a setting. Throws an exception if the setting does not exist.

```lua
app.focus()
```

Brings the window to front and sets input focus.

```lua
app.create_memory_device(
    -- entry-point name
    name: str
)
```

Creates an in-memory filesystem.

```lua
app.get_content_sources() -> table<string>
```

Returns a list of content sources (paths), in descending priority order.

``lua
app.set_content_sources(sources: table<string>)
```

Sets a list of content sources (paths). Specified in descending priority order.

``lua
app.reset_content_sources()
```

Resets content sources.
